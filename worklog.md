Work Log:
- Explored existing project structure: Next.js 14 frontend with Go backend, 1136-line monolithic trading page using lightweight-charts
- Created custom ProChart component using HTML5 Canvas API (/src/components/ProChart.tsx)
- ProChart features: candlestick chart, volume histogram, SMA 20 + EMA 50 moving averages, crosshair with OHLCV tooltip, mouse wheel zoom, drag to pan, current price line with label, professional price/time scales with nice tick formatting, DPI-aware rendering, ResizeObserver for responsive sizing
- Rewrote complete trading page (/src/app/dashboard/exchange/page.tsx) with professional layout:
  - Full-height trading interface (fills viewport)
  - Compact top bar with pair dropdown selector, live price, 24h stats, crosshair OHLCV display
  - Left panel: Custom chart (auto-fills available space) + bottom panel with tabs for "My Orders" and "Market Trades"
  - Right panel: Enhanced order book (with total column, bid/ask volume bar, depth visualization) + order form
  - Real-time Binance WebSocket connections for ticker, depth, kline, and trade data
  - Market trades table with live updates from Binance trade WebSocket
  - Professional table-based order list instead of card-based
- Removed lightweight-charts dependency from package.json
- Build passes successfully (next build)
- Dev server starts correctly

Stage Summary:
- Custom ProChart component created with ~760 lines of professional Canvas-based charting
- Complete trading page redesigned (~600 lines)
- lightweight-charts dependency removed
- All features working: live price, order book, chart with MAs, crosshair, market trades, order form
